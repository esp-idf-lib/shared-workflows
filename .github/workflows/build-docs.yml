        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          Publish generated HTML files on GitHub Pages when true. When false,
          the default, the workflow builds the documentation only.

          Before using this feature, configure the repository from which
          workflows call this workflow.

          Visit [Settings] > [Pages] (in the side bar at left) > [Source],
          and choose [GitHub Actions] as [Source] (under [Build and deployment]).
          Otherwise, the workflow fails.

          Next, call this workflow with permissions with

          * pages: write
          * id-token: write

          The calling workflow should look like:
